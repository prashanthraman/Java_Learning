## Sample 5 - learning Interface and OOPS concepts
1) Method Overloading - Process of calling the same method with different parameters.
2) Method Overriding - Process of calling the same method with different functionality in child class.
3) Encapsulation - Hiding the methods and variable within a class.


etc...

Created package com.prashanth.learning.s5.interface
Tried implementing Interface. Also implemented below:
1) Method Overloading - Process of calling the same method with different parameters.
2) Method Overriding - Process of calling the same method with different functionality in child class.
3) Encapsulation - Hiding the methods and variable within a class.

#### Need Clarifiaction:
1) Confused slightly on Method Overloading. When it will be useful? Anyway we have to create n times the same method by passing different parameters. - Can be used in scenarios where object remains same but different parameter causes different effect. Eg: Car might be petrol or diesel. Based on fuel type it generator different power and mileage.
2) Not sure how to use the toString method.

## 03/23
Updated package com.prashanth.learning.s5.interface
Worked on comments given by Senthur. Some of it include:
a) Class name must be singular.
b) Class name should not have any "_".
c) For method overloading give a better description in sysout to see which method is getting called.
d) Package name should have only lower case letters.
Learned enumerator concept and applied it for size of the bird.
